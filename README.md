This presentation is a professional recap of all the work completed throughout our NLP course, showcase key concepts, tools, and workflows we've learned and applied. We began by creating and organizing our projects using GitHub, ensuring proper version. From there, we followed the eight essential steps in creating NewsBot Intelligence System.
